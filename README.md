# Flashlights for all!

![demo](img/demo.webm)

**Automatically** gives every weapon a statless flashlight and laser.

To apply this gadget to existing weapons, add then remove a gadget. It will be automatically applied to new weapons. Any applied gadget will overwrite the default attachment.

Works exactly the same as normal lasers and flashlights

If you wish to change the laser or flashlight colour, use a mod like [Lasers+](https://modworkshop.net/mod/20577).

## Notice About Removal

Before removing this mod, ensure you have equipped gadgets on, or sold all of every weapon purchased or modified after the installation of this mod.
